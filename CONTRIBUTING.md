# Contributing to GS Mapper

Thanks for looking at the code. Contributions are welcome — a few practical
notes so your first PR isn't blocked on nit-picks.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsasaki0109/gs-mapper.git
cd gs-mapper
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Optional backends (only if you're touching those code paths):

- **DUSt3R** / **MAST3R** pose-free — `git clone` the upstream repos, set
  `DUST3R_PATH` / `MAST3R_PATH` to the clones, download the checkpoints
  listed in the [Credits](README.md#credits) section.
- **gsplat** training — `pip install -e ".[gsplat]"`. Needs CUDA.
- **nerfstudio** secondary trainer — `pip install -e ".[nerfstudio]"`.
- **COLMAP** — `sudo apt install colmap` (Ubuntu) or `brew install colmap`
  (macOS). Only needed for `gs-mapper preprocess --method colmap`.

## Before you push

```bash
# format + lint
ruff format src/ tests/ scripts/
ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/

# full test suite (skip the e2e directory if it's empty)
pytest tests/ -q --ignore=tests/e2e
```

CI runs the same three commands on every PR against Python 3.10, 3.11, and
3.12. All three suites must go green before a merge. 330+ tests usually
complete in under 30 seconds.

## Branch + PR conventions

- Branch from `main` with a `codex/<short-topic>` prefix (example:
  `codex/scene-picker`). Matches existing branch history and makes it
  obvious the change came through the repo's dev-agent workflow.
- One logical change per PR. Bundling two independent improvements is OK
  if the description explicitly says so.
- `git commit` messages: **do not** add `Co-Authored-By:` trailers unless
  the human maintainer explicitly asks. This repo's commit attribution is
  owner-only.
- `gh pr create --body` bodies: **do not** add "Generated with Claude
  Code" / AI-attribution footers. Same reason — owner-only.
- PR title: imperative, under 72 chars. Example:
  `add MAST3R pose-free backend (metric-aware sibling of DUSt3R)`.

## What goes where

| Kind of change | Landing spot |
|----------------|--------------|
| New CLI subcommand / flag | `src/gs_sim2real/cli.py` + matching handler + a parser test under `tests/test_cli.py` |
| Pose-free backend | `src/gs_sim2real/preprocess/pose_free.py` + a `scripts/run_<name>.py` thin CLI + `tests/test_run_<name>_script.py` smoke |
| Training / exporter | `src/gs_sim2real/train/` + `src/gs_sim2real/viewer/web_export.py` |
| New bundled demo splat | `docs/assets/outdoor-demo/<name>.splat` + entry in `docs/scenes-list.json` + matching `tests/test_pages_assets.py` assertion |
| Viewer change | `docs/splat.html` / `docs/splat_spark.html` / `docs/splat_webgpu.html` + shared `docs/scene-picker.js` when adjusting picker behaviour |
| Outdoor-pipeline context / decision log | `docs/plan_outdoor_gs.md` (not the README) |
| User-facing quickstart / demo story | `README.md` + `docs/images/demo-sweep/` thumbnails |

## Bundled demo splats

When you add a new `.splat` under `docs/assets/outdoor-demo/`, three things
need to stay in sync or CI will fail:

1. Register it in `docs/scenes-list.json` so every viewer picker sees it.
2. Add an `<option value="assets/outdoor-demo/<name>.splat">` to each of
   `docs/splat.html`, `docs/splat_spark.html`, `docs/splat_webgpu.html`
   (or leave those `<select>`s empty and let `scene-picker.js` auto-populate
   from the JSON).
3. Add a `test_<name>_splat_present` assertion to `tests/test_pages_assets.py`
   mirroring the existing ones (presence + 32-byte alignment + picker link).

Shipped splats are capped at the antimatter15 400 000-gauss / 12.8 MB
budget via `gs-mapper export --format splat --max-points 400000` — please
keep new bundled demos under that cap so GitHub Pages bandwidth stays
predictable. The supervised `outdoor-demo.splat` uses a tighter 80 000-gauss
cap because its dense reconstruction already absorbs the supervised signal
and loads faster on mobile.

## Where to start

Good small first PRs:

- A new `.splat` demo from your own photos via
  `gs-mapper photos-to-splat --preprocess mast3r` — follow the "Bundled
  demo splats" checklist above.
- A new pose-free backend (MAST3R was roughly 200 lines in `pose_free.py`
  + the symmetric `scripts/run_mast3r.py`).
- README / docs clarifications where something is confusing.
- Moving any still-experimental `docs/splat*.html` feature (e.g. LoD
  config, `?cameras=` preset) into the shared `scene-picker.js` hook so
  all three viewers pick it up for free.

## What's intentionally out of scope

See `docs/plan_outdoor_gs.md` §13 for the "don't touch" list — renaming
the `gs_sim2real` package path, merging the `gs-sim2real` legacy alias
away, large-scale DreamWalker reorgs, antimatter15/splat vendored-code
refactors, etc.

## Reporting issues

Open a GitHub issue with:
- A one-line summary in the title.
- The exact `gs-mapper <subcommand> --help` output if the bug is CLI-
  shaped.
- For pose-free / training bugs: OS, GPU (`nvidia-smi | head -3`),
  PyTorch + CUDA versions, DUSt3R/MAST3R commit hashes if applicable.
- A minimal reproducer (a handful of frames in a `.zip` works for
  pose-free complaints; a 100-line synthetic COLMAP text model works for
  trainer complaints).

Thanks again.
