# Experiments

Updated: 2026-04-02T09:43:15.585Z

This repository treats design as an evolving comparison space.
Stable code stays in `core`; competing implementations stay in `experiments` until comparison makes part of them worth keeping.

## Localization Alignment

Align ground-truth route captures and estimated localization poses without committing to a single universal algorithm too early.

### Current Comparison

| Strategy | Tier | Style | Success | Coverage | Pos Err (m) | Yaw Err (deg) | Time Δ (s) | Runtime (ms) | Readability | Extensibility |
