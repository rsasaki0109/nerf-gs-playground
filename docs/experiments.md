# Experiments

Updated: 2026-04-21T12:27:09.436Z

This repository treats design as an evolving comparison space.
Stable code stays in `core`; competing implementations stay in `experiments` until comparison makes part of them worth keeping.

This page is the public index. Full generated comparison tables live in
[docs/experiments.generated.md](experiments.generated.md); accepted/deferred
decisions live in [docs/decisions.md](decisions.md); stable production
surfaces live in [docs/interfaces.md](interfaces.md).

## Regeneration

Run one experiment lab with `--write-docs` to refresh this index,
`experiments.generated.md`, `decisions.md`, and `interfaces.md`:

```bash
gs-mapper experiment render-backend-selection --write-docs --output outputs/render-backend-selection-experiment-report.json
```

Use `gs-mapper experiment --help` for the full lab list.
